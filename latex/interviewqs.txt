1. How much do you enjoy the physics that you do (on a scale of 0-10)?

2. What do you/students find least intuitive in physics/lessons?

3. What is your weakest aspect in your course/teaching?

4. How often do you do physics in your own time (ie out of own interest)
	a) What topics/fields do you usually look at?

5. How often do you do physics in your own time (for revision/work)
	a) What topics/fields do you usually look at?

6. Have you ever written your own program to simulate something you were looking into?
	a) How developed/finished was it?
	b) How did you develop it?
	c) What did you use it for and how?
	d) Did you use it again?
	e) What did you like about it?
	f) What was lacking?

	-then ask for screenshots or whatever

7. Have you ever used an external program to simulate something you were looking into (even like desmos counts)?
	a) How advanced was the thing you were trying to model? (personal opinion)
	b) How did you use it?
	c) Did it cost anything? Did any paid solutions put you off?
	d) How often have you used this program?
	e) What did you like about it?
	f) What was lacking?

	- all questions refer to one specific example (that will be clear) and then i'll get list of total 

8. Have you ever used analytical methods (equations) to model something you were looking into?
	a) How complex did you get? How much time did you spend on it?
	b) What was it?
	c) Would you have benefited from a visible model of what was happening?

	-ask for sample for the write up

9. Have you ever given up on a research project because it was too complex?
	a) What was it?

10. What do you look for in a simulation software? 
	a) How do you prioritise different features over others?

11. Do you enjoy drawing graphs?
