\chapter{Overall System Design}

    I decided to split the system into three sections: project, simulating, building. Within the software, the user will initialise a `project' in a directory. 
    The program will frequently refer to a `source directory', which will be the user's program files by default. 
    This source directory will be configurable by the user, but there is no guarantee that the user changing things on their own won't break some of the functionality.
