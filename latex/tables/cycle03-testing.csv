ID,Reason,Type,Test Data,Expected Outcome
I20,Placing circuit components,Normal,User action (clicking on two points),Correct component is shown connected between the two points
I21,Configuring meters,Normal,User enters acceptable identifier and is able to choose units and resolution with help of the interface,Success
I22,Configuring meters,Erroneous,User enters an identifier that is too long,User is prompted to re-enter identifier
I23,Accuracy of simulation,Normal,Theoretically valid circuit,Meter readings as expected from calculations by hand/real life readings from reconstructed circuit
I24,Accuracy of simulation,Erroneous,Theoretically invalid circuit,Meter readings as expected from calculations by hand/real life readings from reconstructed circuit
