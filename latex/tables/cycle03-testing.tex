        I22 & Configuring meters & Erroneous & User enters an identifier that is too long & User is prompted to re-enter identifier \\ 
        I23 & Accuracy of simulation & Normal & Theoretically valid circuit & Meter readings as expected from calculations by hand/real life readings from reconstructed circuit \\ 
        I24 & Accuracy of simulation & Erroneous & Theoretically invalid circuit & Meter readings as expected from calculations by hand/real life readings from reconstructed circuit \\
