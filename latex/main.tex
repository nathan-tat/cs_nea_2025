    \section{Analysis}
        \subsection{Identification of Problem}
            Often times during research it is important and very helpful to be able to visualise the events that are being analysed. When working with models in two dimensions, it is easy enough to be able to draw out an accurate diagram, even if it may be tedious. However, 2D models are nowhere near as applicable or useful as considering events in three dimensions, stemming from the fact that the world we live in is three-dimensional. Something that would aid intuition and help in problem-solving would be a way to have events modelled quickly, accurately, and clearly, given a set of initial conditions.

        \subsection{Identification of why this problem is solvable by computational methods}
            The key requirements stated above (accuracy, haste, and clarity) lend themselves very well to using computational methods. Computers are able to make calculations orders of magnitude faster than by hand or by analogue machine, and to a virtually arbitrary degree of accuracy. Many modern central processing units (CPUs) are also able capable of making use of concurrent processing, further increasing the advantage that a computer would have over a human. Graphical processing units (GPUs) are specifically designed for parallel processing, making them especially useful for graphics, which would allow for high quality renders for the user to be able to see. Any data that you would need to consider can be displayed in a clear and user-friendly fashion, making it highly customisable to fit the individual persons needs and for many attributes to be studied at the same time.

        \subsection{Description of the Current System}
            Without using computer simulations, the usual process is to produce a handful of equations by hand that would model the attributes (usually the path taken in 3D) of an object. This has the benefit of giving exact values and equations that are very useful when trying to understand the underlying reasons for an event happening. For example when considering a pendulum, it is clear from the equation $$ T = 2 \pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}} $$ that the period of the pendulum $T$ does not depend on the mass of the object doing the swinging. However, when running computer simulations, such relationships may not be as obvious, and as computers aren't able to analytically solve problems (i.e. through the use of rigorous mathematics), this is a drawback that I have to consider.
